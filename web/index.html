<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>
    This is an advanced graduate course on system programming
    using the C programming language. C is a low-level
    system language specially designed to build system
    software such as operating system kernels, compilers,
    network stacks, database engines, and browsers, among
    others.
    In this course, we will study the basic design disciplines
    of these systems, and investigate how and why C is the
    right language for these tasks.
</p>
<p>
    We will be employing a "learning-by-doing" rational in
    course, that is, we will be building diverse and practical
    systems using C: a compiler, a shell, a Web server,
    a network sniffer,
    a concurrence library, a debugger, and a MapReduce library.
</p>
<p>
    To realize this rational, we have 7 labs planned
    in this course:
    <ul>
        <li>Lab 0: Software Setup</li>
        <li>Lab 1: Compiler</li>
        <li>Lab 2: Shell</li>
        <li>Lab 3: Network Sniffer</li>
        <li>Lab 4: Debugger</li>
        <li>Lab 5: Concurrency</li>
        <li>Lab 6: MapReduce (Tentative)</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    We hope that, by the end of this course, you will not only
    learn the essence of C programming, but also (and more
    importantly) gain
    a deeper understanding of computer systems
    and system-level programming.
