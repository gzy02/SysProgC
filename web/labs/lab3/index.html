<h2>Part A: Web Server</h2>

<h3>1. Square Server</h3>
<p>
    In this part, you need to implement a square server. The server
    fetch a number <samp>n</samp> from the client,
    calculates its square <samp>n*n</samp> then returns
    the result to the client.
    And when the client inputs a special command <samp>bye</samp>,
    should disconnect from the server.
</p>

<h4>The Socket</h4>
<p>
    The socket interface provides a mechanism for setting up a
    communication channel to another host system.
</p>

<p>
    The server calls <samp>socket()</samp> to create a new
    socket. Like other IPCs such as pipes or memory mapped files,
    sockets are treated as files, thus it is convenient to
    process sockets with file operations (e.g., one can read
    file a socket with <samp>read()</samp>).
</p>

<pre>
    /* defined in sys/socket.h */
    int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
</pre>

<p>
    The <samp>domain</samp> field declares the socket domain,
    indicating whether the socket belongs to IPv4, IPv6, or
    Unix. The <samp>type</samp> field determines the type of
    the socket:
    byte stream, datagram, or raw data. The <samp>protocol</samp>
    field indicates the protocol to be used in this socket.
</p>

<p>
    Some typical values for the field <samp>domain</samp>
    has been listed in the following table. For example, the
    constant <samp>AF_INET</samp>  indicates an IPv4 network,
    whereas <samp>AF_INET6</samp>  indicates an IPv6 network.
</p>
<table border="1">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Field</th>
        <th>Constant</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="4">domain</td>
        <td>AF_INET</td>
        <td>IPv4 addresses</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>AF_INET6</td>
        <td>IPv6 addresses</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>AF_LOCAL</td>
        <td>Unix domain socket</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>AF_NETLINK</td>
        <td>Netlink socket</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


<h4>Server Socket Interface</h4>
<p>
    After creating a socket, the server can make use of the
    following three function to accept requests from clients
    (The well-known <samp>bind-listen-accept</samp> socket
    programming idiom.)
</p>
<pre>
    int bind(int socket, const struct sockaddr *address, socklen_t address_len);
    int listen(int socket, int backlog);
    int accept(int socket, struct sockaddr *address, socklen_t *address_len);
</pre>
<p>
    First, the <samp>bind()</samp> function binds the current socket
    to an address.
    Second, the <samp>listen()</samp> function
    converts the socket to a connection-oriented
    server socket with a designated request queue.
    The second parameter,
    <samp>backlog</samp>, sets up the maximum number of enqueued
    connection
    requests.
    Finally, a call to function <samp>accept()</samp>
    establishes connections with incoming requests.
    The accept() function is blocking, so the process will block
    until a new request arrives. When a new request arrives,
    <samp>accept()</samp> establish
    the connection with a new socket, storing the client address
    in the <samp>address</samp> variable.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <b>Exercise 1:</b>
    Read the code in the file <samp>square-server.c</samp>, we have
    provided you with the aforementioned function calls.
    Make sure you read and understand them before continuing.
    You do not need to write code for this exercise.
</div>


<h4>Client Socket</h4>
<p>
    After creating a server socket, we can develop a client socket
    making requests to the sever socket.
    Compared with server socket, client socket is simpler: it
    just connects to the server by invoking the following function.
</p>

<pre>
    /* defined in sys/socket.h */
    int connect(int socket, const struct sockaddr *address, socklen_t address_len);
</pre>

<div class="required">
    <b>Exercise 2:</b>
    Read the code in the file <samp>square-client.c</samp>, we have
    provided you with the aforementioned function calls.
    Make sure you read and understand them before continuing.
    You do not need to write code for this exercise.
</div>

<p>
    Having finished reading both the server and client code,
    we can (finally) compile and run them, in two separate
    terminals.
</p>
<pre>
    css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>make square-server </kbd>        
    gcc square-server.c -o square-server.out
    ./square-server.out
    Server is listening on port 12345...
    ...
</pre>
<pre>
    css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>make square-client </kbd>  
    gcc square-client.c -o square-client.out
    ./square-client.out
    Connected to server. Enter 'bye' to exit.
    ...
</pre>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 3:</b>
    Finish the square functionality of the server, that is,
    when the client request a number <samp>n</samp>, the
    server calculates and returns <samp>n*n</samp>.
    Do not forget to process the special exiting command
    <samp>bye</samp> from the client.
</div>

<div class="required">
    <b>Exercise 4.</b>
    Extend your square server to calculate squares for
    floating-point numbers, besides integers.<br>

    Hint: You can design your own protocol. For example, when
    the client sends <samp>i 1</samp>, the server treats
    it as an integer, when the client sends <samp>f 1</samp>,
    the server treats it as a float.
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge.</i>
    Suppose you use a socket based on UDP, instead of TCP, how
    can you guarantee that the client can always get the
    square results? Is retry a good idea? Implement your
    idea with a UDP socket.
</div>

<h3>2. Web Server</h3>
<p>
    In this part, we will implement a minimal but working
    HTTP server, to demonstrate how to use TCP sockets to build
    high-level the protocols such as HTTP.
</p>
<p>
    The next figure presents the basic architecture of both a
    Web server and Web client (normally a browser).
    The client sends HTTP requests to the server, and the
    server sends back responses.
</p>
<img src="figures/socket2.png" width="400" alt=""/>

<div class="required">
    <b>Exercise 5.</b>
    We have provided a code skeleton in the file
    <samp>web-server.c</samp>.
    Finish the code for the <samp>GET</samp> request.
    How does your Web server serve files that does not
    exist?
</div>

<p>
    To test your code, open your favorite browser, and
    request some files.
</p>
<pre>
css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>ifconfig</kbd>
eth0: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
      inet 192.168.37.60  netmask 255.255.240.0  broadcast 192.168.47.255
      inet6 fe80::215:5dff:fe9b:2b4e  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
      ether 00:15:5d:9b:2b:4e  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
      RX packets 98802  bytes 62267057 (62.2 MB)
      RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
      TX packets 63864  bytes 17556137
      TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0
</pre>

<p>
    For files does exist on your server, the output looks like:
</p>
<img src="figures/socket10.png" width="400" alt=""/>

<p>
    Otherwise, for non-existent files, the output looks like:
</p>
<img src="figures/socket11.png" width="400" alt=""/>

<div class="required">
    <b>Exercise 6:</b>
    Implement the <samp>DELETE</samp> request. You can refer to the
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE">
        DELETE document</a>
    for details on <samp>DELETE</samp>.
</div>

<div class="required">
    <b>Exercise 7:</b>
    Run your Web server, then enter the following command in the terminal:
<pre>
css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/index_$(printf 'a%.0s' {1..1500}).html?"</kbd></pre>
    What do you observe? How does it threat your server?
    How to mitigate?
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge:</i>
    The current implementation of Web server is single-process,
    that is, it can only server one client at a time.
    Modify the Web server to serve multiple HTTP requests
    simultaneously.
</div>

<h2>Part B: ICMP Tunneling</h2>

<h3>1. Raw Socket</h3>
<p>
    Raw sockets allows us to access and process low-level
    packets. By low-level, we are talking about packets
    at or under the transportation layer. As the following
    figure depicts, the user application can set up socket
    at diverse layers.
</p>
<img src="figures/raw_socket.jpg" width="500" alt=""/>
<p>
    To create a raw socket, we call the <samp>socket</samp>
    function with arguments like the following:
<pre>
    int sock = socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(ETH_P_ALL));</pre>
    which will set up a raw socket at the link layer, that is,
    we can obtain and process all Ethernet packets.
</p>
<p>
    For more information and combination of arguments, you may
    want to refer to some <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/59327439">
    online documents</a>.
</p>

<h3>2. ICMP Tunnel</h3>
<p>
    The firewall of computer will inspect and filter network packets,
    deciding whether to allow or deny the packets based
    on predefined rules and policies.
    For example, firewall sometimes
    blocks access to some ports. However, general firewalls do not
    block the ICMP protocol (ping packets). Therefore, we can
    bypass the firewall by establishing an <emph>ICMP tunnel</emph>.
</p>

<p>
    ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used to send control
    messages in TCP/IP networks, providing feedback for various
    problems that may occur in the communication environment.
    The ICMP packet format is:
</p>
<img src="figures\icmp_format.png" width="350" alt=""/>

<p>
    The query packets in ICMP protocols are classified
    into two categories: <samp>Echo request</samp> and
    <samp>Echo reply</samp>. When an <samp>Echo request</samp>
    packet is sent to a server, it will reply with an
    <samp>Echo reply</samp> packet.
    The useful <samp>ping</samp> command works in this way.
</p>
<p>
    The data structure for ICMP resides in <samp>netinet/ip_icmp.h</samp>:
</p>
<pre>
    struct icmphdr{
      uint8_t type;		/* message type */
      uint8_t code;		/* type sub-code */
      uint16_t checksum;
      union{
        struct{
          uint16_t	id;
          uint16_t	sequence;
        } echo;			/* echo datagram */
        uint32_t	gateway;	/* gateway address */
        struct{
          uint16_t	__glibc_reserved;
          uint16_t	mtu;
        } frag;			/* path mtu discovery */
      } un;
    };
</pre>

<p>
    With this data structure, we can construct ICMP packages.
    ICMP messages have an optional <samp>data</samp> field,
    which we will abuse to transport information.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 1:</b>
    Do we need calculate the <samp>checksum</samp> field for
    the ICMP header? If so, what algorithm we should use?
</div>

<p>
    We use the following structure to organize the data segments:
</p>

<pre>
    typedef struct icmp_tunnel{
        unsigned char sname[NAMESIZE];
        unsigned char dname[NAMESIZE];
        unsigned char data[BUFFSIZE];
    }tunnel;
</pre>

We will put this structure in the data segment of the ICMP packet
and send it to the specified IP with the type <samp>Echo request</samp>.
If the other host is online, it can receive the message we sent, and likewise,
we can also receive the message sent by the other, so ICMP
tunnel communication can be achieved.

<h2>Part C: Network Sniffing</h2>

<h3>1. Promiscuous Mode</h3>
<p>
    Computers are connected to the network through network
    interface cards (NICs). A NIC is a physical or logical connection
    between a computer and the network. Each NIC has a hardware
    address, which is called a MAC address.
</p>
<p>
    When the NIC receives
    a packet from the network, it copies the packet to the memory
    of NIC, and checks the destination address in the header of
    the data frame. If the destination address does not
    match the MAC
    address of the NIC, the packets are discarded without further
    processing. Otherwise,
    the data frame is copied to the kernel
    cache, and the NIC then interrupts to tell the CPU to
    finish processing the data.
</p>
<p>
    Because the NIC discards packets that do not match its MAC
    address, a network sniffer cannot obtain these frames. Fortunately,
    most network cards have a special mode called
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promiscuous_mode">
        promiscuous mode</a>. In this mode, the NIC passes
    <em>all</em> data frames it receives from the network to
    the kernel, regardless of whether the address matches.
</p>
<p>
    In this part, we need to turn on the promiscuous mode
    of the local network card, to sniff packets in the wild.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 1:</b> Read the functions <samp>raw_init()</samp> and
    <samp>clear_flag()</samp> in the file <samp>main.c</samp>,
    to have some ideas on how to enable and disable
    promiscuous mode.
    You do not need to write code for this exercise.
</div>

<h3>
    2. Network Sniffing
</h3>
<p>
    In this part, you need to analyze the structure of
    ARP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP packets and print detailed information
    of them.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <b>Exercise 2:</b> Refer to the ICMP analysis function given in
    <samp>packet-process.h</samp> and <samp>packet-process.c</samp>
    to complete the analysis function of the remaining three packets.
    Fill in the missing code.
</div>
<b>Packet filter</b>
<p>
    During network sniffing, sniffers are often only
    interested in certain types of packets (e.g., TCP packets).
    Therefore, after packets are captured, you need
    to filter out some uninteresting packets.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 3:</b>
    Check the <samp>filter.h</samp> for details of the
    function declarations. Refer to the given function
    <samp>filterByIpAddress()</samp> and <samp>filterByMacAddress()</samp>,
    please complete filter by
    protocol type, and port number. Run your
    program to check if it works correctly.
</div>

<h2>Part D. Packet Spoofing</h2>
<p>
    In this part, you implement packet spoofing. Specifically,
    we have given a program for forging ICMP packet.
    Feel free to refer to code in Part C to create packets.
</p>

    Nevertheless, to forge an initial SYN packet is relatively
    easy.
