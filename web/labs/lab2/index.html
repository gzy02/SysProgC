<h1>Lab 2: Shell</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    A shell is software that provides an interface for
    users of an operating system to provide access to the
    services of kernel.
    On Unix-based or Linux-based operating systems,
    a shell can be invoked through the shell command
    in the command line interface,
    allowing users to direct operations through computer
    commands, texts, or scripts.
</p>
<p>
    In this lab, you will implement a minimal shell similar to the
    shell on Linux.
    The mini shell supports not only basic commands (e.g., ls,
    cat, grep, wc, and sleep), but also compound commands (e.g.,
    pipe, sequential execution, background, and redirection).
</p>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
    When you finished the lab, zip your code files with
    the file
    name <samp>student ID-lab-2.zip</samp>
    (e.g., <samp>SA19225789-lab-2.zip</samp>)
    and submit it to the
    <a href="https://bb.ustc.edu.cn/">Online Teaching
        Platform</a>.
    The deadline is 23:59, Oct. 13, 2023 (Beijing time).
    Any late submission will <b>NOT</b> be accepted.
</p>

<h2>Part A: Introduction to Shell</h2>
<p>
    In this section, let us start by learning what a shell is,
    by going through its basic usage.
    Conceptually, a shell is an ordinary program that reads
    inputs representing commands from the user, and
    executes them accordingly. In Ubuntu, the basic graphical
    interface looks like the figure below.
</p>

<h3>1. Basic Commands:</h3>
<p>
    In computer programming and operating system, "basic
    commands"
    typically refer to a set of core commands or operations that
    provide users or programmers with the ability to perform
    fundamental tasks such as file operations, data input/output,
    and system control. In a Linux Shell environment, basic
    commands
    include operations like <samp>ls</samp>ls (list directory contents),
    <samp>cat</samp>cat (concatenate and display file contents),
    and <samp>echo</samp>
    (output text or variables), among others. These commands
    form the foundation for user interaction with the Linux
    operating system and also serve as the building blocks for
    Shell script programming.
</p>

<h4>
    1.1. ls
</h4>
<p>
    The <samp>ls</samp> (list) command lists all files and folders
    in your current
    working directory. You can also specify paths to other
    directories if you want to view their contents.
</p>

<p>
    For example, to list files in the current directory,
    we can run:
</p>
<pre>
    css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>ls</kbd>
    index.html  labs  resources.html  sampleCode  schedule.html  slides
</pre>
<h4>
    1.2. cat
</h4>
<p>
    The <samp>cat</samp> (short for “concatenate“) command is one
    of the most frequently used commands in Linux/Unix-like
    operating
    systems. This command allows us to create single or multiple
    files, view contents of a file, concatenate files,
    and redirect output in terminal or files.
</p>

<p>The syntax for the <samp>cat</samp> command is:</p>
<pre>
    cat [options] [file]
</pre>
<p>
    For example: the following command will display the
    contents of the
    <samp>a.txt</samp> file in the shell.
</p>
<pre>
    css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>cat a.txt</kbd> 
    Welcome to system programming in C!
</pre>

<h3>Compound Commands:</h3>
<p>
    In Linux, compound commands are advanced constructs that
    combine two or more basic commands to perform more complex
    operations. Compound commands can utilize various elements
    like control structures and operators to facilitate intricate
    tasks. For instance, Pipe Sequence (<samp>|</samp>) allows
    the output of one command to be used as the input for another,
    as in <samp>ls | grep 'txt'</samp>. Background (<samp>&</samp>) lets
    a command run
    in the background, freeing up the terminal for other tasks,
    as in <samp>sleep 10 &</samp>. Redirection allows you to
    redirect the output or input of commands to and from files,
    such as <samp>echo "Hello" > hello.txt</samp>. These compound commands
    greatly enhance the flexibility and power of Linux Shell
    scripting and command-line interaction.
</p>
<h4>
    1. Pipe
</h4>
<p>
    The <samp>pipe</samp> command combines two or more commands
    to redirect their IOs. Generally, the syntax for pipe is:
</p>
<pre>
    command 1 | command 2 | command 3 |...
</pre>
<p>
    where the output of the command 1 is used as the input for
    the command 2. In turn, the output of command 2 is used
    as the input of command 3, and so on.
    For example, suppose we have a file named <samp>name.txt</samp>
    containing student names:
</p>
<pre>
    css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>cat name.txt</kbd>
    Alice
    Lamda
    John
    Mike
    Bob
</pre>
<p>
    Then, to sort this file, we use a pipe:
</p>
<pre>
    css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>cat name.txt | sort</kbd>
    Alice
    Bob
    John
    Lamda
    Mike
</pre>
<p>
    where the output of the command <samp>cat</samp>
    is fed to the command <samp>sort</samp>.
</p>
<h4>
    2. Sequence
</h4>
<p>
    How to run two or more terminal commands at once, but
    one by one?
    The semicolon <samp>;</samp>
    operator allows us to execute multiple
    commands in succession.
</p>

<p>
    The general syntax for sequence is:
</p>
<pre>
    command 1; command 2; command 3; ...
</pre>
<p>
    For example, the command:
</p>
<pre>
    css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>ls; pwd; whoami</kbd>
    index.html  labs  resources.html  sampleCode  schedule.html  slides
    /home/css-lab
    css-lab
</pre>
<p>
    will give us a listing of the current directory
    (<samp>ls</samp>), find out
    the directory you are currently
    in (<samp>pwd</samp>), and display your login name
    (<samp>whoami</samp>) all at once.

</p>

<h4>
    3. Background
</h4>
<p>
    Typically, when you run a command in the terminal, you have
    to wait until the command finishes before you can
    enter another one. This is often called running the command in
    the foreground or foreground process.
    When a process runs in the foreground, it occupies your
    shell.
</p>
<p>
    What if the command takes a long time to finish, and you
    want to run other commands in the meanwhile?
    You have several options at your disposal. The most obvious
    and straightforward option is to start
    a new shell session and run the command in it. Another option
    is to run the command in the background (thus, the process
    is called a background process).
</p>
<p>
    A background process is a process/command that is started
    from a terminal and runs in the background,
    without interaction from the user.
</p>

<p>
    To run a command in the background, add the ampersand
    symbol (<samp>&</samp>)
    at the end of the command with this syntax:

</p>
<pre>
    command &
</pre>
<p>
    For example, you can run:
</p>
<pre>
    css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>gedit &</kbd>
    css-lab@tiger:~$
</pre>
<p>
    to start the gedit text editor from your terminal, running
    as a background process.
</p>

<h4>
    4. Redirection
</h4>
<p>
    Redirection is a feature allows us to change the
    standard input/output device, when executing a
    command.
</p>

<p>The general syntax for output redirection is:</p>
<pre>
    command > file
</pre>
which redirects the standard output to the <samp>file</samp>.
<p>
    For example, the command
</p>
<pre>
    css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>ls > listing</kbd>
    css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>cat listing</kbd>
    files.txt
    index.html
    labs
    resources.html
    sampleCode
    schedule.html
    slides
</pre>
<p>
    will redirect the output of command <samp>ls</samp> to
    a file “listing”,
    instead of to your screen (that is, the stdout).
</p>

    <b>Exercise 1</b>: If you add a background command after
    the pipeline command, can the pipeline work?

<h2>Part B: Principle</h2>
<p>
    As Figure 1.1 shows, Unix takes the traditional form of a
    <i>kernel</i>, a special program that provides
    services to running programs. Each running program, called a
    <i>process</i>, has memory containing
    instructions, data, and a stack. The instructions implement
    the computation of program. The data
    are the variables on which the computation acts. The stack
    organizes the procedure calls of program.
    A given computer typically has many processes but only a
    single kernel.
</p>

<p>
    When a process needs to invoke a kernel service, it invokes
    a <i>system call</i>, one of the calls in
    the operating system interface. The system call enters
    the kernel; the kernel performs the service
    and returns. Hence, a process alternates between executing
    in <i>user space</i> and <i>kernel space</i>.
</p>
<img src="figures/os.PNG" height="240" width="530" alt=""/>


<p>
    The shell is an ordinary program that reads commands from
    the user and executes them. The
    fact that the shell is a user program, and not part of the
    kernel, illustrates the power of the system
    call interface: there is nothing special about the shell.
    It also means that the shell is easy to replace;
    as a result, modern Unix systems have a variety of shells
    to choose from, each with its own user
    interface and scripting features.
</p>

<h3> Processes and Memory</h3>
<p>
    When a process is not executing, the operating system saves
    its CPU registers, restoring them when it next runs the
    process. The kernel associates a process identifier,
    or PID, with each process.
</p>
<p>
    A process may create a new process using the <samp>fork</samp>
    system call.
    <samp>Fork</samp> gives the new process
    exactly the same memory contents (both instructions and data)
    as the calling process.
    <samp>Fork</samp> returns
    in both the original and new processes. In the original process
    , <samp>fork</samp>
    returns the PID of new process
    . In the new process, <samp>fork</samp> returns zero.
    The original and new processes are often called the
    <i>parent</i> and <i>child</i>.
</p>
<p>
    For example, consider the following program fragment written
    in the C programming language:
</p>
<pre>
    int pid = fork();
    if(pid > 0){
        printf("parent: child=%d\n", pid);
        pid = wait((int *) 0);
        printf("child %d is done\n", pid);
    } else if(pid == 0){
        printf("child: exiting\n");
        exit(0);
    } else {
        printf("fork error\n");
    }
</pre>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 2</b>: What would be the result of the
    program without
    this line <samp>pid = wait((int *) 0)</samp>?
</div>

<p>
    The <samp>exec</samp> system call replaces the memory of
    calling process with
    a new memory image loaded
    from a file stored in the file system. The file must have
    a particular format, which specifies which
    part of the file holds instructions, which part is data,
    at which instruction to start, etc.
    When <samp>exec</samp> succeeds, it does not return
    to the calling program; instead, the instructions loaded
    from the file start executing at the entry
    point declared in the ELF header. <samp>Exec</samp> takes
    two arguments:
    the name of the file containing the
    executable and an array of string arguments. For example:
</p>
<pre>
    char *argv[3];
    argv[0] = "echo";
    argv[1] = "hello";
    argv[2] = 0;
    exec("/bin/echo", argv);
    printf("exec error\n");
</pre>
<p>
    This fragment replaces the calling program with an
    instance of the program
    <samp>/bin/echo</samp> running
    with the argument list <samp>/bin/echo</samp>.
    Most programs ignore the first element of the argument
    array,
    which is conventionally the name of the program.
</p>
<p>
    The shell uses the above calls to run programs on
    behalf of users.
    The main structure of the shell is simple; see
    <samp>main</samp> (src/main.c).
    The main loop reads a line of input from the user .
    Then it analyzes the input from the user with yyparse.
    Then it calls <samp>fork</samp>, which creates a copy
    of the shell process.
    The parent calls <samp>wait</samp>,
    while the child runs the command. For example, if the
    user had typed
    “<samp>echo hello</samp>” to the shell,
    <samp>yyparse</samp> would have been called with
    “<samp>echo hello</samp>” as the argument.
    <samp>Cmd_run</samp> (src/ast.c) runs
    the actual command. For “<samp>echo hello</samp>”,
    it would call <samp>execv</samp> (src/ast.c).
    If <samp>execv</samp> succeeds then
    the child will execute instructions from
    <samp>echo</samp> instead of
    <samp>Cmd_run</samp>. At some point <samp>echo</samp>
    will call
    <samp>exit</samp>, which will cause the parent to
    return from
    <samp>wait</samp> in <samp>main</samp> (user/sh.c:145).
</p>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 3</b>: Can <samp>fork</samp> and <samp>exec</samp>
    be combined in one call?
</div>

<p></p>

<h3>I/O and File Descriptors</h3>
<p>
    A <i>file descriptor</i> is a small integer representing
    a kernel-managed object that a process may read
    from or write to. A process may obtain a file descriptor
    by opening a file, directory, or device,
    or by creating a pipe, or by duplicating an existing descriptor.
    For simplicity, we will often refer
    to the object a file descriptor refers to as a “file”; the
    file descriptor interface abstracts away the
    differences between files, pipes, and devices, making them
    all look like streams of bytes. We will
    refer to input and output as <i>I/O</i>.
</p>

<p>
    Every process has a private space of file descriptors
    starting at zero. By convention, a process reads
    from file descriptor 0 (standard input), writes output
    to file descriptor 1 (standard output), and
    writes error messages to file descriptor 2 (standard error).
    As we will see, the shell exploits the
    convention to implement I/O redirection and pipelines.
</p>

<p>
    The <samp>read</samp> and <samp>write</samp>
    system calls read bytes from and write bytes to open files
    named by file
    descriptors. The call
    reads at most <samp>n</samp> bytes from the file descriptor
    <samp>fd</samp>,
    copies them into <samp>buf</samp>, and returns the number
    of bytes read.
    Each file descriptor that refers to a file has an offset
    associated with it.
    <samp>Read</samp> reads data from the current file offset
    and then advances that offset
    by the number of bytes read: a subsequent <samp>read</samp>
    will return
    the bytes following the ones returned by the first
    <samp>read</samp>.
    When there are no more bytes to read, <samp>read</samp>
    returns zero to indicate the end of
    the file.
</p>
<p>
    The call <samp>write(fd, buf, n)</samp> writes <samp>n</samp>
    bytes from <samp>buf</samp> to the file descriptor
    <samp>fd</samp>
    and returns the number of bytes written. Fewer than
    <samp>n</samp>
    bytes are written only when an error occurs. Like
    <samp>read</samp>,
    <samp>write</samp> writes data at the current file
    offset and then advances
    that offset by the number of bytes
    written: each <samp>write</samp> picks up where the
    previous one left off.
</p>

<p>
    The following program fragment (which forms the essence
    of the program <samp>cat</samp>)
    copies data
    from its standard input to its standard output. If an
    error occurs, it writes a message to the standard
    error.
</p>
<pre>
    char buf[512];
    int n;
    for(;;){
        n = read(0, buf, sizeof buf);
        if(n == 0)
            break;
        if(n < 0){
            fprintf(2, "read error\n");
            exit(1);
        }
        if(write(1, buf, n) != n){
            fprintf(2, "write error\n");
            exit(1);
        }
    }</pre>
<p>
    The important thing to note in the code fragment is
    that <samp>cat</samp>
    does not know whether it is reading from a file, console,
    or a pipe. Similarly, <samp>cat</samp>
    does not know whether it is printing to a console, a file,
    or whatever. The use of file descriptors
    and the convention that file descriptor 0 is input and
    file descriptor 1 is output allows a simple implementation
    of <samp>cat</samp>.

</p>
<p>
    The <samp>close</samp> system call releases a file
    descriptor,
    making it free for reuse by a future <samp>open</samp>,
    <samp>pipe</samp>, or <samp>dup</samp>
    system call (see below). A newly allocated file descriptor
    is always the lowest-numbered
    unused descriptor of the current process.
</p>
<p>
    File descriptors and <samp>fork</samp> interact to make
    I/O redirection easy to implement.
    <samp>Fork</samp> copies the file descriptor
    table of memory along with its memory,
    so that the child starts with exactly the same open files
    as the parent.
    The system call <samp>exec</samp> replaces the memory of
    calling process but
    preserves its file table. This behavior allows the shell
    to implement <i>I/O redirection</i> by forking,
    re-opening chosen file descriptors in the child, and then
    calling <samp>exec</samp>
    to run the new program. Here
    is a simplified version of the code a shell runs for the
    command <samp>cat < input.txt </samp>:
</p>
<pre>
    char *argv[2];
    argv[0] = "cat";
    argv[1] = 0;
    if(fork() == 0) {
        close(0);
        open("input.txt", O_RDONLY);
        exec("cat", argv);
    }</pre>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 4</b>: How does the above program implement input
    redirection?
</div>

<p>
    Although <samp>fork</samp> copies the file descriptor
    table,
    each underlying file offset is shared between
    parent and child. Consider this example:

</p>
<pre>
    if(fork() == 0) {
        write(1, "hello ", 6);
        exit(0);
    } else {
        wait(0);
        write(1, "world\n", 6);
    }</pre>
<p>
    At the end of this fragment, the file attached to file
    descriptor 1 will contain the data
    <samp>hello world</samp>.
    The <samp>write</samp> in the parent (which, thanks to
    <samp>wait</samp>, runs only after the child is finished)
    picks up where
    the <samp>write</samp> of child left off. This behavior
    helps produce
    sequential output from sequences of shell
    commands, like <samp>(echo hello; echo world) >output.txt
</samp>.

</p>
<p>
    The <samp>dup</samp> system call duplicates an existing
    file descriptor,
    returning a new one that refers to
    the same underlying I/O object. Both file descriptors
    share an offset, just as the file descriptors
    duplicated by <samp>fork</samp> do.
    This is another way to write <samp>hello world</samp>
    into a file:
</p>
<pre>
    fd = dup(1);
    write(1, "hello ", 6);
    write(fd, "world\n", 6);</pre>
<p>
    Two file descriptors share an offset if they were derived
    from the same original file descriptor
    by a sequence of <samp>fork</samp> and <samp>dup</samp>
    calls.
    Other file descriptors do not share offsets, even if they
    resulted from <samp>open</samp> calls for the same file.
</p>
<p>
    File descriptors are a powerful abstraction, because they
    hide the details of what they are con-nected to:
    a process writing to file descriptor 1 may be writing to a
    file, to a device like the console, or to a pipe.

</p>
<h3>Pipes</h3>
<p>
    A <i>pipe</i> is a small kernel buffer exposed to processes
    as a pair of file descriptors, one for reading
    and one for writing. Writing data to one end of the pipe
    makes that data available for reading from
    the other end of the pipe. Pipes provide a way for processes
    to communicate.
</p>
<p>
    The following example code runs the program <samp>wc</samp>
    with standard input connected to the read end of a pipe.
</p>
<pre>
    int p[2];
    char *argv[2];
    argv[0] = "wc";
    argv[1] = 0;
    pipe(p);
    if(fork() == 0) {
        close(0);
        dup(p[0]);
        close(p[0]);
        close(p[1]);
        exec("/bin/wc", argv);
    } else {
        close(p[0]);
        write(p[1], "hello world\n", 12);
        close(p[1]);
    }</pre>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 5</b>: For the two lines
    <samp>close(0); dup(p[0])</samp>;
    can we reorder them?
</div>
<p>
    The program calls <samp>pipe</samp>, which creates a new
    pipe and records the
    read and write file descriptors
    in the array <samp>p</samp>. After <samp>fork</samp>,
    both parent and child have file descriptors referring to
    the pipe. The
    child calls <samp>close</samp> and <samp>dup</samp>
    to make file descriptor zero refer to the read end of the
    pipe, closes the
    file descriptors in <samp>p</samp>, and calls <samp>exec</samp>
    to run <samp>wc</samp>. When <samp>wc</samp> reads from its
    standard input,
    it reads from the pipe. The parent closes the read side of
    the pipe, writes to the pipe,
    and then closes the write side.
</p>
<p>
    If no data is available, a <samp>read</samp> on a pipe waits
    for either data
    to be written or for all file descriptors referring to the
    write end to be closed; in the latter case,
    <samp>read</samp> will return 0, just as if the end of
    a data file had been reached. The fact that <samp>read</samp>
    blocks
    until it is impossible for new data to arrive
    is one reason that it is important for the child to close the
    write end of the pipe before executing
    <samp>wc</samp> above: if one of the file
    descriptors of <samp>wc</samp>
    referred to the write end of the pipe, <samp>wc</samp> would
    never see
    end-of-file.
</p>
<p>
    In our lab, we can implement pipelines such as
    <samp>grep fork ast.c | wc -l</samp>
    similar to the above code . The child process creates a pipe
    to connect the left end of the
    pipeline with the right end. Then it calls <samp>fork</samp>
    and <samp>Cmd_run</samp> for the left end of the pipeline and
    <samp>fork</samp> and <samp>Cmd_run</samp> for the right end,
    and waits for both to finish. The right end of the pipeline
    may be a command that itself includes a pipe (e.g.,
    <samp>a | b | c</samp>),
    which itself forks two new child
    processes (one for <samp>b</samp> and one for <samp>c</samp>).
    Thus, the shell may create a tree of processes. The leaves
    of this tree are commands and the interior nodes are processes
    that wait until the left and right
    children complete.
</p>
<p>
    We can use temporary files to achieve functions similar to
    pipes. For example, the pipeline
</p>
<pre>
    css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>echo hello world | wc</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    could be implemented without pipes as
</p>
<pre>
    css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>echo hello world >/tmp/xyz; wc &lt/tmp/xyz</kbd>
</pre>

    <b>Exercise 6</b>: What are the advantages of pipes over
    temporary files in this situation?

<h2>Part C: Implementation</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    To implement this shell, firstly, we need to read a line of
    input from the user
    and save the command in a suitable data structure. Then we
    need to execute it.
</p>
<h3>Step 1: Preparation</h3>
<p>
    This experiment requires the installation of flex and bison.
    Please refer to lab0 for the installation process.
</p>

<p>
    Download the <a href="../lab2.zip">source code</a> and unzip.
    This source code is incomplete, you need to fill in the correct
    code blocks so that the shell can execute the command correctly.
</p>
<h3>Step 2: Define the Data Structure</h3>
<p>
    Let us see <samp>ast.h</samp>.
    First define an enumerated type, listing the types of five
    commands supported by our shell.
    Then define five structs, corresponding to the basic command
    and four compound commands,
    sequential execution, background, redirection, pipe.
    In addition, this file also declares five functions:
</p>
<pre>
    Cmd_t Cmd_Atom_new(struct node *);
    Cmd_t Cmd_Seq_new(Cmd_t left, Cmd_t right);
    Cmd_t Cmd_Back_new(Cmd_t back);
    Cmd_t Cmd_Pipe_new(Cmd_t left, Cmd_t right);
    Cmd_t Cmd_Redir_new(Cmd_t left, Cmd_t right, int fd);
</pre>
<p>
    The role of these functions is to use arguments to construct
    the five structs
    defined above. These functions are called in the process of
    parsing commands(<samp>parser.y</samp>).
    After the parsing process is over, the information in the
    command is stored in
    an abstract syntax tree composed of structs.
</p>
<p>For example, for this command:</p>
<pre>
    css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>cat hello.txt | grep -n hello > c.txt</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    In the <samp>main.c</samp>, after calling the
    <samp>yyparse()</samp>,
    We can get an abstract syntax tree(AST), the simplified
    structure is as follows:
</p>
<img src="figures/ast1.PNG" height="400" width="500" alt=""/>
<p>
    The leaves of this AST are basic commands.
    The variable <samp>root</samp> is a pointer to the root
    node of the abstract syntax tree.
</p>
<p>
    Function <samp>void Cmd_print(Cmd_t cmd)</samp>
    can print out the commands read by the shell, and
    Function <samp>void Cmd_run(Cmd_t cmd)</samp>
    will execute the commands read by the shell.
</p>
<h3>Step 3: The Constructor of Each AST Node</h3>
<P>
    In the file <samp>ast.c</samp>, we have given the construction
    function of leaf nodes (e.g., <samp>Cmd_t Cmd_Atom_new(struct node *)</samp>)
    and a construction function of internal nodes
    (e.g., <samp>Cmd_t Cmd_Seq_new(struct Cmd_t *left, struct Cmd_t *right)</samp>).
</P>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 7</b>: Please complete the
    corresponding part in:
    <pre>
    Cmd_t Cmd_Back_new(Cmd_t back);
    Cmd_t Cmd_Pipe_new(Cmd_t left, Cmd_t right);
    Cmd_t Cmd_Redir_new(Cmd_t left, Cmd_t right, int fd);</pre>
    Hint: you can refer to the data structure defined
    in the file <samp>ast.h</samp>.
</div>
<h3>Step 4: Print AST</h3>
<p>
    The function <samp>void Cmd_print(Cmd_t cmd)</samp>
    will print out the commands entered by the user, solely to check
    whether
    the abstract syntax tree (AST) is constructed correctly.
</p>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 8</b>: Please complete the
    <samp>void Cmd_print(Cmd_t cmd)</samp>.
    Then call <samp>void Cmd_print(Cmd_t cmd)</samp> in
    <samp>main.c</samp>. You may want to comment out
    the function <samp>Cmd_run(root)</samp>.
    <p>
        Finally, compile and run the project, then
        use the following test cases to check whether your
        solution is correct.
    </p>
    <pre>
        css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>cat hello.txt | grep -n hello > c.txt ; ls -l</kbd>
        css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>sleep 10 &</kbd>
    </pre>
</div>

<h3>Step 5: Run Command</h3>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 9</b>: Please complete the
    <samp>void Cmd_run(Cmd_t cmd)</samp>.
    Regarding redirection commands, you only need to
    implement output redirection. Commands like this:
    <pre>
        css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>cat hello.txt > c.txt </kbd>
    </pre>
    Then call <samp>void Cmd_run(Cmd_t cmd)</samp>
    in <samp>main.c</samp> and comment out
    <samp>Cmd_print(root)</samp>.
    Finally, compile and run the project, and
    use the following test cases to justify your
    answer.
    <pre>
        css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>cat hello.txt | grep -n hello>c.txt; cat c.txt; ls</kbd>
    </pre>
    Before entering the command, create a file called
    <samp>hello.txt</samp>
    in the current working directory. The content of
    the file is as follows:
    <pre>
        hello
        hello;
        hello world!
    </pre>

    Next, enter the following command:
    <pre>
        css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>sleep 10 &</kbd>
    </pre>
    what do you observe?
