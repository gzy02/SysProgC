<h1>Lab 1: Compiler</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    A compiler is an important software infrastructure to
    translate source programs developed using high-level language
    (e.g., C, Python, or Java)
    into semantic equivalent binary programs in low-level languages
    (e.g., x86, RISC, or ARM). Furthermore, the generated binary
    programs by a compiler are linked against libraries to
    create the final executables.
</p>
<p>
    In this lab, you will gain a deeper understanding of
    compiler by creating a toy compiler from a minimal subset
    of C to RISC-V. In the meanwhile, you will implement a minimal
    subset of C libraries to understand how to create language
    libraries (runtimes) in general.
</p>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
    When you finished the lab, zip your code files
    with the file name <samp>student ID-lab-1.zip</samp>
    (e.g., <samp>SA19225789-lab-1.zip</samp>)
    and submit it to the
    <a href="https://bb.ustc.edu.cn/">Online
        Teaching Platform</a>.
    The deadline is 23:59, Oct. 13, 2023 (Beijing time).
    Any late submission will <b>NOT</b> be accepted.
</p>

<h2>Part A: Libraries</h2>
<p>
    C language library files are a collection of precompiled
    functions and data that can be reused in programs.
    Library files provide a modular way to organize and
    share code for reuse in different programs.
    In this section, let us start by implementing a minimal
    C library: <samp>mini-lib</samp>. You should download
    this <a href="../lab1.zip">code skeleton</a> to start with.
</p>

<p>
    The following figure depicts the overall structure of
    the software stack: on top of the underlying hardware
    are operating systems which manages not only resources
    but also applications; libraries reside in the middle
    level which utilized operating system resources via
    system calls; applications reside on top of
    the software stack, which may invoke functions in
    libraries or operating systems.

    <b>Exercise 1: </b>
    We have provided the implementation of a library
    <samp>puts()</samp>. In this exercise, your job is
    to understand the implementation the
    function, but do not need to write any new code.

    The <samp>puts()</samp> function sends a string to
    the standard output. You can find the code
    in the <samp>mini-lib.c</samp> file in lab1.
    <pre>
    int puts(char *s) {
        long n = strlen(s);
        long r;
        asm(CALL(SYS_WRITE)
        "movq $1, %%rdi\n"
        "movq %1, %%rsi\n"
        "movq %2, %%rdx\n"
        "syscall\n"
        "movq %%rax, %0\n"
        : "=r"(r)
        : "r"(s), "r"(n)
        : "%rax", "%rdi", "%rsi", "%rdx");
        return (int)r;
    }
    </pre>
    This library makes use of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call">
        system calls</a>
    to implement its functionalities. Specifically, we make
    use of the Linux
    <a href="https://blog.rchapman.org/posts/Linux_System_Call_Table_for_x86_64/">
        x86-64 system calls</a>, which is useful
    to understand this code. You may also want to refer to
    the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Extended-Asm.html">
    inline assembly specification</a>.
    <p>
        Here, we make a self-contained explanation to
        the above code: this code implements the system call
    </p>
    <pre>
        write(fd, buf, size)
    </pre>
    according to the system call specification, the system call
    number (i.e., <samp>$1</samp>) is loaded into the
    <samp>%rax</samp> register, and the arguments
    <samp>fd</samp>, <samp>buf</samp>, and <samp>size</samp>
    are loaded into registers <samp>%rdi</samp>,
    <samp>%rsi</samp>, and
    <samp>%rdx</samp>, respectively.
    When the system call returns, the return value resides
    in the <samp>%rax</samp> register.

<div class="required">
    <b>Exercise 2: </b>
    Implement the <samp>exit()</samp> function, which
    terminates the execution of a program and exits, with
    the following prototype:
    <pre>
    void exit(int status);
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="required">
    <b>Exercise 3: </b>
    Implement the <samp>alarm()</samp> functions, which
    sets up a timer that fires a signal (SIGALARM)
    after a specified time interval, with the following
    prototype:
    <pre>
    int alarm(unsigned int seconds);
    </pre>
    <p>
        After implementing the <samp>puts()</samp>,
        <samp>exit()</samp>, and
        <samp>alarm()</samp> functions, compile and run
        the project to justify your answer.</p>
    <pre>
    css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>./notmain.out</kbd>
    </pre>
    <p>
        The result are similar to the output below.
    </p>
    <pre>
    hello, world
    hello, world
    hello, world
    hello, world
    hello, world
    Alarm clock
    </pre>

<h2>Part B: The <samp>mcc</samp> Compiler</h2>

<p>
    In this section, we are going to read and understand a
    compiler called <samp>mcc</samp>. <samp>mcc</samp> is
    a toy compiler
    from <samp>MiniC</samp> (a minimal subset of C), to
    x86-64.
    Then, you will extend the <samp>mcc</samp> compiler
    to support RISC-V, a recent and popular RISC ISA.
</p>

<h3>Software setup</h3>
<p>
    Before writing any code, you should first set up
    required software. Specifically, we need
    <samp>flex</samp> and <samp>bison</samp> to build the
    compiler front-end: <samp>flex</samp> is a tool used
    for generating lexical analyzers, whereas
    <samp>Bison</samp> is a tool used for generating syntax
    analyzers.
</p>
<pre>
    css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>sudo apt-get install flex</kbd>
    css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>sudo apt-get install bison</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    To double-check the installation is successful:
</p>
<pre>
    css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>flex --version</kbd>
    css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>bison --version</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    You do not need to write any code for flex and bison in
    this lab. But you can refer to the
    <a href="https://westes.github.io/flex/manual/">
        flex document</a> and
    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/bison.html">
        bison document</a>, if you are interested.
</p>

<p>
    To use <samp>mcc</samp> compile code, you need make it
    first, and then you can use <samp>mcc</samp> to compile
    your code. For example:
</p>
<pre>
    css-lab@tiger:~/lab1/mcc$ <kbd>make</kbd>
    css-lab@tiger:~/lab1/mcc$ <kbd>./mcc input.c</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    <samp>mcc</samp> will compile <samp>input.c</samp>
    and generate an executable named <samp>a.out</samp> in
    current directory.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <b>Exercise 4.</b>
    Read and understand the code for compiler pipeline.
    What does the compiler do when the parameters <samp>"-o"</samp>,
    <samp>"-S"</samp>, <samp>"-c"</samp>, <samp>"-m"</samp>
    and <samp>"-v"</samp> are added or not, and how can these
    parameters be used in combination?
</div>


<div class="required">
    <b>Exercise 5.</b>
    First, you should read the code generation
    for x86-64, and understand the code generation
    algorithm. How does <samp>mcc</samp> implement an assignment
    statement like <samp>a = a + 5</samp>.
    What about an output statement <samp>print(a)</samp>?

</div>

<div class="required">
    <b>Exercise 6.</b>
    Implement code generation for RISC-V.
    <p>
        Hint: You should install the RISC-V environment
        on your Ubuntu.<br/>
        Install RISC-V cross-compiler tool:
    <pre>
        css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>sudo apt install gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu</kbd></pre>

    Select a directory to pull the source of <samp>spike</samp>
    and compile it:
    <pre>
        css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>sudo apt install g++</kbd>
        css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler</kbd>
        css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-sim</kbd>
        css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>cd riscv-isa-sim</kbd>
        css-lab@tiger:~/riscv-isa-sim$ <kbd>mkdir build</kbd>
        css-lab@tiger:~/riscv-isa-sim$ <kbd>cd build</kbd>
        css-lab@tiger:~/riscv-isa-sim/build$ <kbd>../configure</kbd>
        css-lab@tiger:~/riscv-isa-sim/build$ <kbd>make</kbd>
        css-lab@tiger:~/riscv-isa-sim/build$ <kbd>sudo make install</kbd>
    </pre>
    To double-check the installation is successful:
    <pre>
        css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>spike --help</kbd>
    </pre>

    Use static link to generate final executables.
    For example, to compiler the file <samp>hello.c</samp>:
    <pre>
        css-lab@tiger:~/lab1/mcc$ <kbd>riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc -static hello.c</kbd>
        css-lab@tiger:~/lab1/mcc$ <kbd>spike pk a.out</kbd>
        bbl loader
        hello, world
    </pre>
</div>
